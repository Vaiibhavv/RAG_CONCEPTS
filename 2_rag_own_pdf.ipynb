Living beings\\nhave to per form several basic activities to\\nsurvive.  We call such activities ‘life processes’.\\nThe energy for these pr ocesses comes fr om\\nfood. We need energy for other activities like\\nplaying, singing, r eading, writing, thinking,\\njumping, cycling and running.  Activities that\\nare strenuous r\\nequire more energy.\\nAnimals too get engaged in activities.  For\\nexample, they may jump and run.  They have\\nto fight, move away fr om enemies, find food\\nor find a safe place to live. Also, we engage\\nsome animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull\\ncarts or plough fields.  All such activities\\nrequire energy.\\nThink of machines. List the machines that\\nyou have come across. What do they need for\\ntheir working? Why do some engines require\\nfuel like petr ol and diesel?  Why do living\\nbeings and machines need energy?\\n10.1Work\\nWhat is work? There is a dif ference in the\\nway we use the term ‘work’ in day-to-day life\\nand the way we use it in science.  T o make\\nthis point clear let us consider a few examples.\\n10.1.1NOT MUCH ‘ WORK’ IN SPITE OF\\nWORKING HARD!\\nKamali is pr eparing for examinations. She\\nspends lot of time in studies. She reads books,\\ndraws diagrams, organises her thoughts,\\ncollects question papers, attends classes,\\ndiscusses pr oblems with her friends, and\\nperforms experiments.  She expends a lot of\\nener gy on these activities. In common\\nparlance, she is ‘working hard’. All this ‘hard\\nwork’ may involve very little ‘work’ if we go by\\nthe scientific definition of work.\\nYou are working hard to push a huge rock.\\nLet us say the rock does not move despite all\\nthe ef fort. Y ou get completely exhausted.\\nHowever, you have not done any work on the\\nrock as there is no displacement of the rock.\\nYou stand still for a few minutes with a\\nheavy load on your head.   You get tired. You\\nhave exerted yourself and have spent quite a\\nbit of your energy. Are you doing work on the\\nload?  The way we understand the term ‘work’\\nin science, work is not done.\\nYou climb up the steps of a staircase and\\nreach the second floor of a building just to\\nsee the landscape from there.  You may even\\nclimb up a tall tree.  If we apply the scientific\\ndefinition, these activities involve a lot of work.\\nIn day-to-day life, we consider any useful\\nphysical or mental labour as work. Activities\\nlike playing in a field, talking with friends,\\nhumming a tune, watching a movie, attending\\na function ar e sometimes not consider ed to\\nbe work.  What constitutes ‘work’ depends\\non the way we define it. W e use and define\\nthe ter m work dif ferently in science.

T o\\nunderstand this, we shall first consider the\\ncase when the force is acting in the direction\\nof displacement.\\nLet a constant for ce, F\\n act on an object.\\nLet the object be displaced through a\\ndistance, s in the direction of the force (Fig.\\n10.1). Let W be the work done. We define work\\nto be equal to the pr oduct of the for ce and\\ndisplacement.\\nWork done = force × displacement\\nW = F s  (10.1)\\nin day-to-day life. For each of these\\nactivities, ask the following questions\\nand answer them:\\n(i) What is the work being done on?\\n(ii) What is happening to the object?\\n(iii) Who (what) is doing the work?\\n10.1.2SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION OF WORK\\nTo understand the way we view work and\\ndefine work from the point of view of science,\\nlet us consider some situations:\\nPush a pebble lying on a sur face. The\\npebble moves through a distance. You exerted\\na for ce on the pebble and the pebble got\\ndisplaced. In this situation work is done.\\nA girl pulls a trolley and the trolley moves\\nthrough a distance.  The girl has exerted a\\nforce on the trolley and it is displaced.\\nTherefore, work is done.\\nLift a book thr ough a height. T o do this\\nyou must apply a for ce.  The book rises up.\\nThere is a force applied on the book and the\\nbook has moved.  Hence, work is done.\\nA closer look at the above situations\\nreveals that two conditions need to be\\nsatisfied for work to be done: (i) a force should\\nact on an object, and (ii) the object must be\\ndisplaced.\\nIf any one of the above conditions does\\nnot exist, work is not done. This is the way\\nwe view work in science.\\nA bullock is pulling a cart.  The cart\\nmoves. There is a force on the cart and the\\ncart has moved. Do you think that work is\\ndone in this situation?\\nActivity _____________ 10.2\\n• Think of some situations from your\\ndaily life involving work.\\n• List them.\\n• Discuss with your friends whether\\nwork is being done in each situation.\\n• Try to reason out your response.\\n• If work is done, which is the force acting\\non the object?\\n• What is the object on which the work\\nis done?\\n• What happens to the object on which\\nwork is done?\\nFig. 10.1\\nThus, work done by a force acting on an\\nobject is equal to the magnitude of the force\\nmultiplied by the distance moved in the\\ndir ection of the for ce. W ork has only\\nmagnitude and no direction.\\nIn Eq. (10.1), if F\\n = 1 N and s = 1 m then\\nthe work done by the for ce will be 1 N m.\\nHere the unit of work is newton metre (N m)\\nor joule  (J).

This is because work is\\ndone on it against gravity while it is being\\nraised. The energy present in such an object\\nis the gravitational potential energy.\\nThe gravitational potential ener gy of an\\nobject at a point above the ground is defined\\nas the work done in raising it from the ground\\nto that point against gravity.\\nIt is easy to arrive at an expr ession for\\nthe gravitational potential energy of an object\\nat a height.\\nFig. 10.7\\nConsider an object of mass, m. Let it be\\nraised through a height, h fr\\nom the ground.\\nA force is required to do this. The minimum\\nforce required to raise the object is equal to\\nthe weight of the object, mg. The object gains\\nenergy equal to the work done on it.  Let the\\nwork done on the object against gravity be\\nW. That is,\\nwork done, W = force × displacement\\n= mg × h\\n= mgh\\nSince work done on the object is equal to\\nmgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained\\nby the object. This is the potential energy (EP)\\nof the object.\\nEp = mgh (10.6)\\nMore to know\\nThe potential energy of an object at\\na height depends on the ground level\\nor the zero level you choose.  An\\nobject in a given position can have a\\ncertain potential energy with respect\\nto one level and a different value of\\npotential energy with respect to\\nanother level.\\nIt is useful to note that the work done by\\ngravity depends on the difference in vertical\\nheights of the initial and final positions of\\nthe object and not on the path along which\\nthe object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case\\nwhere a block is raised from position A to B\\nby taking two different paths. Let the height\\nAB = h.

What happens to the total\\nenergy of a system during or after the process?\\nWhenever energy gets transformed, the total\\nenergy remains unchanged. This is the law of\\nconservation of energy. According to this law,\\nenergy can only be converted from one form\\nto another; it can neither be created or\\ndestroyed. The total energy before and after\\nthe transformation remains the same. The law\\nof conservation of energy is valid                  in\\nall situations and for all kinds of\\ntransformations.\\nConsider a simple example. Let an object\\nof mass, m be made to fall freely from a     height,\\nh. At the start, the potential energy is mgh and\\nkinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic\\nenergy zero? It is zero because its velocity is\\nzero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh.\\nAs it falls, its potential energy will change into\\nkinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object\\nat a given instant, the kinetic energy would be\\n½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the\\npotential energy would decrease while the\\nkinetic energy would increase. When the object\\nis about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v will\\nbe the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy\\nwould be the largest and potential energy the\\nleast.  However, the sum of the potential energy\\nand kinetic energy of the object would be the\\nsame at all points. That is,\\npotential energy + kinetic energy = constant\\n   or\\n1 constant.\\n2\\n2mgh + mv = (10.7)\\nThe sum of kinetic energy and potential energy\\nof an object is its total mechanical energy.\\nWe find that during the free fall of the object,\\nthe decrease in potential energy, at any point\\nin its path, appears as an equal amount of\\nincrease in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of\\nair resistance on the motion of the object has\\nbeen ignored.) There is thus a continual\\ntransformation of gravitational potential\\nenergy into kinetic energy.\\nReprint 2025-26'),\n",
